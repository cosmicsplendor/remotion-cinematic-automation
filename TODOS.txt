1. Still the initial zump needs to be fixed
2. now disregards speed
3. implement aspect data extraction automation
4. extend the cards a bit more towards the edges (leaving only 96px buffer)
5. either keep the images in past events (try first) or clip it smoothly
6. add support for videos
7. add support for fade in or out
8. that aspect matching logic and proper zoom to account for clipping still flawed - should be declarative, almost magical
9. add support for more easing functions
